# 🎮 LibGDX Base Project for Rapid Prototyping

This repository provides a clean and ready-to-use **LibGDX base project** designed for developers who want to quickly experiment with new gameplay mechanics, systems, or ideas **without starting from scratch**.

You can clone this project and immediately begin testing new features in a structured LibGDX environment.

It is also suitable for beginners who want to understand how a simple LibGDX project is organized in practice.

## ✅ What is already set up?

This project intentionally keeps things minimal while providing a solid foundation:

* Tiled map integration
* Basic character rendering
* Camera setup
* Screen structure
* Project architecture ready for extension
* Clean and understandable code structure

> No animations, no Box2D, no complex systems — this is intentional.
> This project is meant to be a **sandbox** for your own experiments.

## 🚀 How to use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProGencel/libGDX-Base-Project
```

Then open the project with **IntelliJ IDEA** and run the **DesktopLauncher**.

You are now ready to start experimenting.

## 🧪 How to experiment with new features

Create your new systems, mechanics, or experiments inside the project and plug them into the existing structure.
You don't need to deal with project setup, window creation, or map integration.

Focus only on what you want to test.
